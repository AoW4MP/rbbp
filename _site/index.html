                AoW 4 Evolved is a balance mod aimed at simultaneous turn multiplayer.<br>
                However, the mod can also be applied to single player games to shake things up and experience a more rounded game.<br><br>
                This mod makes a lot of tweaks to all aspects of the game, from Units to City Structures to the Empire Tree.<br>
                It also includes some major mechanic overhauls such as reworking how (Signature) Hero Skills and Friendly Domain features work.<br><br>
                The goal of the mod is to expand the game with more viable gameplay options and strategies (looking at you Order and Nature affinities).<br>
                This is mainly achieved by buffing underperforming options, but there are also times where something is so blatantly overpowered that it must be nerfed or risk always being a must-pick.<br><br>
                However, balance can only take us so far. Therefore a few key mechanics have been overhauled and are now more reminiscent of previous AoW games.<br>
                Of course this doesn't come without its own risks and the mod will be continually evaluated and iterated upon over time.<br>
                <br>
                Aside from general balance, the most impactful changes are as follows:
